// Library/framework = code written by someone else that can be used.
// library   - when you call the library youre in control
// -- library is a collection of functionality that you call! 

// framework - control flow is inverted - framwork calls you! 
// -- all the control flow is already in the framework!
// takes all the basic stuff every app needs and packages it up! 
// lets you focus on the content instead of all the basic stuff

// eg express - web dev framework
